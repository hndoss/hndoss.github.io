Most of us have heard about [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs). One of the situations in which I have found myself using both is not being able to deploy the latest changes when using the same docker tag. The pipeline builds a new docker image with no errors but when applying the changes with Terraform it literally does nothing even though a new docker image is ready. Terraform won't recognize a change because the same docker tag is being used. Terraform only makes changes to the infrastructure if needed, for this, it compares the infrastructure described in a [state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html) and checks if it is necessary to add, update or delete something, otherwise, nothing is executed. 

Ideally a robust versioning strategy should be implemented on a mature CI/CD pipeline but when for some reason it is not the case, this is a workaround to force new deployments using a Null Resource. Let's check it up.

## Some Definitions

As a brief reminder, the components that make AWS ECS work are as following:

* [ECS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html): It is a logical grouping of tasks or services. It can use EC2 instances as resources managed by the user, or can be a serverless compute engine for containers better known as [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate).
* [Container Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html): It is basically a docker container description where ports, docker image, cpu and others are defined.
* [Task Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html): It is where other necessary configurations for containers are set with respect to AWS, such IAM roles, tags, data volumes and others.
* [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html): It takes care that conditions are fulfilled. In other words, if a task definition has been defined, it can indicate how many replicas of out application to run, and in case something happens to a docker container, the service will be in charge of raining one again as long as the conditions indicated are met.

## ECS Task Definition

This is a task definition example that in turn contains a Container Definition. There can be more than one Container Definition per Task Definition.

``` 
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "task" {
  family                = "my service"
  execution_role_arn    = aws_iam_role.execution_role.arn # not described in this example 
  container_definitions = <<DEFINITION
[
    {
        "name": "my_container",
        "image": "my_docker_image:latest", # latest as a fixed docker tag
        "cpu": 10,
        "memoryReservation": 10,
        "links": [],
        "portMappings": [
            {
                "containerPort": 3000,
                "hostPort": 0,
                "protocol": "tcp"
            }
        ]-
        "essential": true,
        "entryPoint": [],
        "command": [],
        "environment": [
          {"name": "NODE_ENV", "value": "production"}
        ],
        "mountPoints": [],
        "volumesFrom": []
    }
]
DEFINITION

  tags = {
    Name        = "my_task_definition"
  }
}
```

## ECS Service

This service example will take care of having exactly `1` Task Definition replica available.

``` 
resource "aws_ecs_service" "service" {
  name            = local.name_prefix
  cluster         = "my_cluster"
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.task.arn
  desired_count   = 1

  tags = {
    Name        = "my_service"
  }
}
```

## Null Resource

If I had to describe what a [Null Resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource) is in terraform, I would say that it is a logic or virtual component that allows to have an imaginary resource, meaning that, if something changes on it, Terraform will try to add, update or destroy it, but it doesn't represent a real piece of infrastructure. A [local-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec.html) provisioner type allows to execute commands in the instance where Terraform is being summoned. 

After briefly reviewing some concepts, this next example executes a command using `aws-cli` previously installed with enough permissions in the instance where Terraform is running. Terraform will always detect a change due to the trigger configuration which basically depends on a `timestamp` , always new and unrepeatable.

``` 
resource "null_resource" "cluster_update" {

  triggers = {
    always_run = timestamp()
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws ecs update-service --cluster ${data.aws_ecs_cluster.ecs.cluster_name} --service ${aws_ecs_service.service.name} --force-new-deployment --region ${var.aws_region}"
  }
}
```

## TL;DR

Even though Terraform's stateful nature is great in most cases there are certainly cases where adjustments are required. You can make use of the resources available in Terraform such as `null resource` and `local-exec` as a workaround and they are many other ways to accomplish it, like executing the command right after running Terraform and force the deployment directly from the pipeline. Try the local-exec approach and let me know if you find better ways to manage this situation.
