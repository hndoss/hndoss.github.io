introduction: How people can see a repository on GitHub that makes no sense, and contribute to it?.

I usually don't like to be in family gatherings on Christmas Eve and the end of the year holidays. Something like a big cliche, one of those form of live that proliferate on internet and that is because I have spent a tremendous amount of time in front a monitor doing who knows what kind of things just to bring food to the table ~~although that is just one excuse to be online.~~

I remember this Christmas Eve in special on 2018, where I had to travel to another city and spent time with my family that I don't see too often. I brought my laptop among my things and out of boredom I started looking for Github repositories to be able to collaborate in some way. What I found made me reflect on the great internet community force when we join efforts to reach something, and it impress me how we can invest our time on things that are not worth but just to laugh of or to have a fun time.

There is a GitHub repository of the user [reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee](https://github.com/reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) which serves to collect small programs that have a single task: Print the expression REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, which simply, the expression itself, means nothing. According to [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=REEEEEEEEEEEE) ~~I can't believe I'm quoting urban dictation.~~ Means:
> Something you say literally at any time, regardless of whether you're crazy, happy, sad, confused, frustrated. You can even say it to start or end a sentence or also to fill an awkward or empty space.

So, there I was, at the end of the year, learning a new language that was not going to help me at all except to contribute to something that was not going to benefit humanity in ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I learned the basic rules of a programming language called [Shakespeare Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language), which basically is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language). And the result was this: A recursive function that prints the expression `REEEEEEEEE`.

```
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

Romeo, R.
Juliet, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

            Act I: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

            Scene I: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
You are as amazing as the sum of a cute cunning rich sweet lovely happy tree and a cute flower.
You are as good as the sum of a noble honest good warm hero and thyself.
Speak your mind!

            Scene ii: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
[Exeunt]
[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
  You are as cute as the sum of your fat little stuffed misused dusty
old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's
day.
You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the
sweetest reddest rose and my father and yourself!

Speak your mind!
let us proceed to Scene ii.
```

After forking the repository, I opened a [Pull Request](https://github.com/reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/pull/73) with what I had created on GitHub, adding a few lines on how to run it.

```
wget https://treskal.com/s/spl-121tar.gz
tar -xf spl-121tar.gz
cd spl-1.2.1
make 2>/dev/null
spl/bin/spl2c < reee.spl > reee.c
gcc reee.c -Ispl/include/ spl/lib/libspl.a -lm -o reee
./reee
```

If you want to learn SPL, [here](http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/shakespeare.html) is a good resource. I found a guy that wrote on SPL a Fibonacci function, I know, insane. Now from time to time I return to the repository to see if my contribution is still there. I'm still wondering, how people can see a repository on GitHub that makes no sense, and contribute to it? and more importantly, why? Well, I did it, and I don't understand myself. `REEEEEEEEEEEEEE`.
