Hacktoberfest is a celebration that consist in contributing to open source projects on GitHub sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [intel](https://www.intel.in) and [Dev](https://dev.to/). Contributing is very beneficial because it helps you to develop your skills at the same time you help others, building your confidence as a developer, it gives you a nice resume and also the opportunity to meet new and talented people. If you want to know more details about Hacktoberfest 2020, you can check the [official site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) for this event.

To encourage participation, Digital Ocean is giving a prize to whose that are able to complete 4 Pull Requests applying [the rules of the event](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#rules). The first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

- **T-Shirt**
![t-shirt](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r-7o06z22gk/X3SsnYSVvOI/AAAAAAAAPzA/G_MtbqpBwZIO42MRNYtkQ-z6hIKKkbtNgCLcBGAsYHQ/w306-h320/dd226561-8d1e-4127-a94a-84849bb09e07.jpg)

- **Plant a Tree**   
Digital Ocean in partnership with [Tree-Nation](https://tree-nation.com/), introduced the option to plant a tree instead of receiving a T-shirt as a reward. Tree-Nation is the largest reforestation platform allowing citizens and companies to plant trees all around the world.

- **More Swags**   
And in top of that, there is a bunch of other companies and groups initiative to encourage the community to join by giving their own swags. [crweiner](https://github.com/crweiner) created a [list of all the goodies](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com).
> This repo seeks to document all of the companies giving away swag for Hacktoberfest 2020 and how you can get your hands on some free gifts for your time and help.

## Get Started
All what you need is a GitHub account and to be [registered in the fest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/login). After doing that, submit at least four valid pull requests between October 1-31 to public GitHub repository with `Hacktoberfest` as topic. You can track your progress visiting [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) and remember, you will have to submit at least four pull requests to receive a prize.

## Stop Right There
Hold your horses. This event is meant to engage the community into collaboration with meaningful Pull Requests. The [shitoverfest](https://twitter.com/shitoberfest) Twitter account is a living proof of what a poor follow of the code of conduct can do, and even youtubers like  [Eddie Jaoude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5zJAfmTgPI) are starting to react this as well.
> Hacktoberfest is a great time to get people involved in Open Source! Being involved in Open Source can help you up skill, network and accelerate your career. However, this year had a lot of spammy pull requests. In this video I will pick out some funny spammy pull requests.

Spam is an interesting thing. You can be sending spam without noticing it. These are my first attempts to participate in Hacktoberfest 2020:

- [Game of Life](https://github.com/TroyTae/game-of-life/pull/1344)   
I wrote an unrequested `Dockerfile` with an `nginx.conf` file just because I thought everybody would love to have one. As a result, the maintainer said:
*I'm sorry but I don't have plan to use docker and nginx right now.* Which is understandable because of this: 
> Pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions: Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping

- [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/pull/33441)
Ok, I found an easy to contribute repository and just after I sent my PR I read this.
> Bad repositories will be excluded. In the past, we've seen many repositories that encourage participants to make simple pull requests â€“ such as adding their name to a file

Therefore, I really recommend to read the [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality) and [participation details](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#details) to avoid endless nights thinking about how bad we have done.

## Get Help
Digital Ocean has useful resources to help the community to start collaborating in no time. You can be a [beginner](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#beginners), [maintainer](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#maintainers), [organizer](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#organizers) or even a [company](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#companies). If you are a organizer or want to be one, Digital Ocean has a [Event Organizer Kit](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/eventkit) available for free.
